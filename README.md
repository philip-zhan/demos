## ðŸ”¥ Why You'll Love It

- **Ship quicker**: Address review feedback without delay
- **Secure by design**: We prioritize the security and privacy of your code

## ðŸ”’ Security and Privacy

We understand the importance of code security and privacy. Here's how we protect your code:

- **Server-Side Processing**: Proton processes review feedback on our secure servers to provide fixes.
- **Isolated Execution**: Each code generation task runs in an isolated, ephemeral container using Azure Container Apps jobs. The container is destroyed after the task completes.
- **Open Source Agent**: The core code modification agent is open-source ([Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)), allowing for transparency.
- **Data Handling**: We temporarily clone relevant parts of your repository into the isolated container for analysis and modification. The code and the container are deleted immediately after processing. We'll never store your code.
- **AI Model**: We utilize Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro as the foundation model, which offers best-in-class coding performance and privacy. (Read more about privacy [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/data-governance))
